"""
This module implements the Orchestrator-workers workflow pattern for agent-based task execution
as described in https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents.

It provides an Orchestrator class that can generate and execute plans using multiple specialized agents.
The workflow supports both full and iterative planning strategies.

The prompts used in this implementation are inspired by:
https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent/blob/main/src/mcp_agent/workflows/orchestrator/orchestrator_prompts.py

PLANNER_PROMPT = """
You are an expert planner. Given an objective task and a list of agents (which are collections of tools and capabilities), 
your job is to break down the objective into a series of steps, which can be performed by these agents.
"""

ITERATIVE_PLAN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are tasked with determining only the next step in a plan
needed to complete an objective. You must analyze the current state and progress from previous steps 
to decide what to do next.

A Step must be sequential in the plan, but can have independent parallel subtasks. Only return a single Step.

Objective: {{OBJECTIVE}}

{{PLAN_RESULTS}}

If the previous results achieve the objective, return is_complete=True.
Otherwise, generate the next Step.

You have access to the following agents:

### Agents Description ###

{{AGENTS_DESCRIPTION}}

### End of Agents Description ###

Generate the next step, by specifying a description of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel:
For each subtask specify:
    1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute  
    2. Name of one agent to use for the task

Return your response in the following JSON structure:

FULL_PLAN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are tasked with orchestrating a plan to complete an objective.
You can analyze results from the previous steps already executed to decide if the objective is complete.
Your plan must be structured in sequential steps, with each step containing independent parallel subtasks.

{{PLAN_RESULTS}}

If the previous results achieve the objective, return is_complete=True.
Otherwise, generate remaining steps needed.

You have access to the following agents:

Generate a plan with all remaining steps needed.
Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.
For each Step, specify a description of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel.
For each subtask specify:
    1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute  
    2. Name of one agent to use for the task
