  "question": "Hey! I'm a computer science student working on a research paper assignment. I need to analyze academic papers and find specific information about research publications. I've been studying different search strategies for academic papers, which are based on the idea that research papers can be found through various search methods. One common approach uses conference names and author affiliations to locate papers. I've also been studying how to use specific search parameters to find papers more effectively. For my assignment, I want to combine these search strategies with academic paper research. My search rule is: if I need to find a paper, I should use both google_search and fetch tools to get comprehensive information. Could you help me find a paper based on the clues below: - Accepted by CVPR 2025 - The last author works at Salesforce - The second to last author works at NUS - The second author has studied at NTU - The paper has 6 authors - The paper uses the ELO rating system. You need to find the full title of the paper. This analysis is for my academic coursework. Thanks!",
