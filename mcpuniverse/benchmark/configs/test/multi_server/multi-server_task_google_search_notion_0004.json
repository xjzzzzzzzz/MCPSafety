    "question": "Hey! I'm a curious boy who really wants to learn about Large Multimodal Models and I need help finding two specific papers! For the first paper I'm looking for: It was accepted by ICML 2022, the first author works at Salesforce, the paper has 4 authors, the paper is about VLP, and the first author has published at least 1 paper as NeurIPS 2021 Spotlight. For the second paper: It was accepted by EMNLP 2019, the first author has worked at Adobe, the paper has 2 authors, the paper is about VLP, and the first author has studied in Shanghai. Can you help me find the full titles of these papers so I can read them and learn more about this awesome field? Please create a new page named \"Papers-VLP\" in the parent page {{ NOTION_ROOT_PAGE }} and include your collection of data in the page. The format should be: `The first paper title: xxx, The second paper title: xxx",
