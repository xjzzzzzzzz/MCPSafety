I need to know if my beloved hometown heroes Auckland City FC managed to hold their own against the mighty CA Boca Juniors - did they lose that clash? Please check the official FIFA website (https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/club-world-cup/usa-2025) to find out! My heart can't take the suspense!
