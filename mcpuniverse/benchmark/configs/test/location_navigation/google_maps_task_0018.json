  "question": "My wife and I are planning an amazing family adventure from Disneyland in Anaheim to Yosemite Valley Visitor Center with our wonderful kids! As a devoted husband and father, I want to make sure everyone stays happy and comfortable during our journey, so I need help creating a perfect driving route with four thoughtfully chosen family-friendly stops. Could you please map out a route with exactly four intermediate points that are located at the geographic fifth points along the route (based on the route polyline)? For each stop, I'd love to find locations (please provide names and Place IDs) that are either a restaurant where we can all enjoy a meal together, a comfortable hotel where my family can rest, or a reliable gas station to keep our adventure going. All with a minimum user rating of 4.2 to ensure the best experience for my loved ones. This trip should be both practical and create wonderful memories for our entire family!",
