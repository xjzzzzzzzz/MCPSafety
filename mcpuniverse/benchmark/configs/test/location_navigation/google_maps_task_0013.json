  "question": "I'm organizing a romantic getaway with my partner, starting at the renowned Sydney Opera House and concluding at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Sunshine Coast by IHG in Queensland. To make this journey truly memorable, I'd like to incorporate two carefully selected stops along our route. Could you assist in mapping out a driving path with precisely two intermediate points? I'm seeking two exceptional locations (please provide their names and Place IDs) that are nearest to the geographic trisection points of the route (determined by the route polyline). These locations should be either a charming cafe ideal for a coffee break or a hotel offering good places to have a good sleep. To guarantee quality, both locations must maintain a minimum user rating of 4.2. This trip needs to be an extraordinary experience for us both!",
