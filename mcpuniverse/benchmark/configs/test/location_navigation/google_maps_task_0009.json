  "question": "My wife and I are planning a wonderful road trip from 'Sydney' to 'Brisbane', and we would be delighted if you could assist us in making this journey truly memorable! We intend to visit exactly 5 charming cities along the way between our starting and ending points. Would you be so kind as to suggest exactly 3 different driving route options for our travels? For each of these routes, we would greatly appreciate if you could identify exactly 2 suitable rest stops within those intermediate cities, ensuring these stops are conveniently located along or close to our planned driving paths (a total of 2 rest stops per route). Furthermore, as we both enjoy beautiful landscapes, could you please recommend exactly 2 scenic viewpoints within those intermediate cities for each route (the cities of the viewpoints should be at least 1 city different from the cities of the rest stops per route), and kindly provide their elevations as well (a total of 2 scenic viewpoints per route)? We must mention that visiting 'Port Macquarie' is essential for our journey. We are very much looking forward to your recommendations for this delightful adventure!",
