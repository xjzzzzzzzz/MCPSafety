  "question": "Hey! My friend and I are planning an epic road trip adventure from 'Seattle' to 'Portland' and we could really use your help to make it awesome! We're thinking of hitting up 3 cool cities along the way to really make the most of our time together. Could you hook us up with 2 different driving route options for this buddy trip? For each route, we'd love to find 1 good rest stop in those intermediate cities where we can grab some snacks and stretch our legs (a total of 1 rest stop per route). Also, since we want to get some great photos for our social media, could you find 1 scenic viewpoint in those intermediate cities with killer views and tell us the elevation (a total of 1 scenic viewpoint per route)? We're super excited about this road trip with the crew!",
