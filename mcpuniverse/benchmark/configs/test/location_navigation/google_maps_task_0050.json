    "question": "I'm organizing a romantic getaway with my partner, starting at the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris and concluding at the Chemin de Fer de Provence in Nice. To make this journey truly memorable, I'd like to incorporate three carefully selected stops along our route. Could you assist in mapping out a driving path with precisely three intermediate points? I'm seeking three exceptional locations (please provide their names and Place IDs) that are nearest to the geographic quarter points of the route (determined by the route polyline). These locations should be either a charming cafe ideal for a coffee break, a boutique hotel offering good places to have a good sleep, or a park for photos. To guarantee quality, all three locations must maintain a minimum user rating of 4.2. This trip needs to be an extraordinary experience for us both!",
