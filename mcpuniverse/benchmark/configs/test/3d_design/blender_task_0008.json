  "question": "Clear the current Blender scene and remove all PolyHaven materials.\nCreate a Cube named 'WoodCube', position it at world coordinates (X=1.0, Y=2.0, Z=1.0), and set its scale factors to (X=4.0, Y=6.0, Z=2.0). Search for a texture asset tagged 'wood'. Download the chosen asset at 2K resolution, allowing it to apply the generated material directly to the 'WoodCube'. Verify that the material assigned to 'WoodCube' is named 'AgedWoodMat', renaming it if necessary. Next, within the Shader Editor for the 'AgedWoodMat' material, confirm or establish the standard PBR node connections to the Principled BSDF shader: connect the Base Color map to the 'Base Color' input; connect the Roughness map (loaded into an Image Texture node set to 'Non-Color' space) to the 'Roughness' input; and connect the Normal map (also loaded via an Image Texture node set to 'Non-Color') through a 'Normal Map' node to the 'Normal' input. Ensure the material retains the default 'Opaque' Blend Mode. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_8.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
