Create a Text object named 'Title' with the text 'Hello World', position it at (X=0, Y=0, Z=0), and set its scale to (2.0, 2.0, 2.0). Create a Bezier Circle named 'Path' with 32 segments and a radius of 3.0, position it at (X=0, Y=0, Z=0). Create a Cone named 'Follower' with 16 vertices and a radius of 0.2, position it at (X=0, Y=0, Z=0). Add a 'Follow Path' constraint to the 'Follower' object, making it follow the 'Path' object. Set the 'Follow Path' constraint's 'Follow Curve' option to enabled and set the 'Forward' option to 'Forward X'. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_overlapping.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
