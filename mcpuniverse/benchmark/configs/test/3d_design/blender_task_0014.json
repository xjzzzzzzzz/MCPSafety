Instead, use Blender's built-in 'Nishita' Sky Texture for the world background. Set the Sky Texture's Sun Elevation to 16.4 degrees, Sun Rotation to 121 degrees, and Air Density to 1.9. Ensure the default Camera exists. Enable Depth of Field for the Camera. Create a new object named 'Pillar' and set it as the Camera's Depth of Field Focus Object. Set the Camera's Aperture F-Stop to 1.2. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_14.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
