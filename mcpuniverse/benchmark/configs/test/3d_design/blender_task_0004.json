    "question": "Clear the current Blender scene and remove all PolyHaven materials.\nAdd a Suzanne (Monkey) primitive named 'Subject', ensuring it is at the world origin (0,0,0) with default rotation and scale. Create an Area light named 'KeyLight', set its shape to 'RECTANGLE' with an X size (size) of 2.0 and Y size (size_y) of 1.0, set its energy to 150W, position it at (X=-3, Y=-4, Z=3), and add a 'Track To' constraint targeting the 'Subject' object, ensuring the light's scale remains (1,1,1). Create a second Area light named 'FillLight', set its shape to 'DISK' with a size (diameter) (size) of 1.5, set its energy to 50W, position it at (X=3, Y=-2, Z=2), and add a 'Track To' constraint targeting the 'Subject' object, ensuring its scale is (1,1,1). Create a Spot light named 'RimLight', set its energy to 200W, its spot size (spot_size) to 25 degrees, its blend factor (spot_blend) to 0.2, position it at (X=0, Y=5, Z=4), and add a 'Track To' constraint targeting the 'Subject' object, ensuring its scale is (0.5,0.5,0.5). Create a Camera named 'MainCamera', position it at (X=0, Y=-6, Z=2), and add a 'Track To' constraint targeting the 'Subject' object, ensuring its scale is (1,1,1). Create an Empty object of type 'Sphere' named 'DOF_Target' and position it precisely at world coordinates (X=0, Y=0, Z=0.5) with default rotation and scale. Finally, configure the 'MainCamera' object's Camera Data properties: enable Depth of Field, set the DOF Focus Object to the 'DOF_Target' object, and set the Aperture F-Stop to 1.8. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_4.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
