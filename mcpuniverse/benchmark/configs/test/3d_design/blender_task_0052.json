  "question": "Clear the current Blender scene and remove all PolyHaven materials.\nCreate a Cube named 'Foundation', position it at the world origin (0,0,0). Create a Cylinder named 'TowerBase', set its creation parameters to have total 16 vertices (up+bottom), a radius of 0.8, and a depth (height) of 4.0, then set its local location relative to 'Foundation' to (X=0, Y=0, Z=4.0). Parent 'TowerBase' to 'Foundation'. Now, create a second Cylinder named 'MidSection'; set its creation parameters to have total 32 vertices (up+bottom), a radius of 0.7, and a depth of 3.0. Parent 'MidSection' to 'TowerBase', and set its local location relative to 'TowerBase' to (X=0, Y=0, Z=8.0). Create a third Cylinder named 'Spire', set its creation parameters to have total 64 vertices (up+bottom), a radius of 0.1, and a depth of 2.0. Parent 'Spire' to 'MidSection', set its local location relative to 'MidSection' to (X=0, Y=0, Z=14.0). Finally, create an Empty object displayed as a 'Cone', name it 'Beacon', parent it to 'Spire', and set its local location relative to 'Spire' to (X=0, Y=0, Z=16.0). After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_52.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
