Change the output resolution to 1350x1080 with a scale of 85%. In the Color Management panel, set the View Transform to Filmic, the Look to High Contrast, and adjust Gamma to 1.2. In the Render Layers Properties, enable Z Pass, Mist, and Normal passes. Go to World Settings and set the background color to a solid light gray using RGB (0.8, 0.8, 0.8). In the Output Properties, set the file format to OpenEXR MultiLayer, enable Zlib compression, and set output color depth to 32-bit float. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_12.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
