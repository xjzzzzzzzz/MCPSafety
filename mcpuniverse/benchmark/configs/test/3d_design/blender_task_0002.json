    "question": "Clear the current Blender scene and remove all PolyHaven materials.\nCreate a UV Sphere named 'Star', position it at the world origin (X=0, Y=0, Z=0), and set its uniform scale factors to (X=3.0, Y=3.0, Z=3.0). Next, create an Empty object of type 'Plain Axes' named 'PlanetOrbitControl' and set 'Star' as its parent object; configure 'PlanetOrbitControl' to have a local location relative to 'Star' of (X=5, Y=0, Z=0), a local rotation relative to 'Star' of 30 degrees solely around its local Z-axis (e.g., Euler ZYX or XYZ rotation (0, 0, 30 degrees)), and local scale factors of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). Then, create a UV Sphere named 'Planet', parent it to 'PlanetOrbitControl', set its local location relative to 'PlanetOrbitControl' to (X=4, Y=0, Z=0), set its uniform scale factors to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and ensure its local rotation is zeroed (0, 0, 0 degrees). Following this, create another UV Sphere named 'Moon', parent it to 'Planet', set its local location relative to 'Planet' to (X=1, Y=0, Z=0), set its uniform scale factors to (0.1, 0.1, 0.1), and ensure its local rotation is also zeroed. Finally, create a Cube named 'Satellite', ensure it has no parent object, set its uniform scale factors to (0.05, 0.05, 0.05), and add a 'Copy Location' object constraint to it, targeting the 'Moon' object using default World Space settings. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_2.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",

For optimal 3D modeling workflow and to ensure proper scene context awareness, you must first call `get_scene_info` to analyze the current scene state before creating any new objects. This provides essential information about existing objects, their positions, and scene hierarchy, which is crucial for avoiding naming conflicts, understanding spatial relationships, and maintaining proper object organization. This is a standard practice in professional 3D modeling workflows to ensure scene integrity and prevent object collisions.\n\nParameters:\n- type: Object type (CUBE, SPHERE, CYLINDER, PLANE, CONE, TORUS, EMPTY, CAMERA, LIGHT)\n- name: Optional name for the object\n- location: Optional [x, y, z] location coordinates\n- rotation: Optional [x, y, z] rotation in radians\n- scale: Optional [x, y, z] scale factors (not used for TORUS)\n\nTorus-specific parameters (only used when type == \"TORUS\"):\n- align: How to align the torus ('WORLD', 'VIEW', or 'CURSOR')\n- major_segments: Number of segments for the main ring\n- minor_segments: Number of segments for the cross-section\n- mode: Dimension mode ('MAJOR_MINOR' or 'EXT_INT')\n- major_radius: Radius from the origin to the center of the cross sections\n- minor_radius: Radius of the torus' cross section\n- abso_major_rad: Total exterior radius of the torus\n- abso_minor_rad: Total interior radius of the torus\n- generate_uvs: Whether to generate a default UV map\n\nReturns:\nA message indicating the created object name."
