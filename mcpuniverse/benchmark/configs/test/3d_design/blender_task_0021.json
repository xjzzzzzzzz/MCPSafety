Create two new Collections in the scene named 'Group_Red' and 'Group_Blue'. Move 'Obj_A' and 'Obj_C' into the 'Group_Red' collection. Move 'Obj_B' into the 'Group_Blue' collection. Ensure these three objects are not also present in the default 'Collection' (Scene Collection). Add a Custom Property to the 'Obj_B' (Sphere) object: set the Property Name to 'AssetID', its Value to the integer 12345, and its Tooltip to 'Sphere Asset Identifier'. After finishing all tasks, create a new file and save it as 'tid_21.blend' in the '{{MCPUniverse_DIR}}/mcpuniverse/evaluator/blender/blend_files'.",
