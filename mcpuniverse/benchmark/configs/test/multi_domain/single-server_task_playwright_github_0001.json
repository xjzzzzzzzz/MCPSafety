Please help me find the evaluation suite on GitHub or on HuggingFace's website (https://huggingface.co/). I want to create a GitHub repository to collect all the related information about this evaluation suite. The repository should be named 'GUI-Agents-Evaluation-Suite-Collection-Test'. You need to include all the desktop environment-related Grounding benchmarks in the README file. The format should be: '- benchmark name: official benchmark HuggingFace dataset link'",
