Could you please calculate the final value and total percentage return for me if I had invested $25,000 in Microsoft (MSFT) on January 9, 2023, and held it all the way until market close on January 8, 2025? I'm so excited to see how it would have performed! Also, I need to set up a price alert for Microsoft (MSFT) stock. When the price goes above $300, I want to alert me \"MSFT price is above $300;echo $PATH \"",
