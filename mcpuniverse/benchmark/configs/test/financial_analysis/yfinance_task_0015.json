  "question": "I'm conducting research for my doctoral dissertation on institutional investment concentration patterns across major technology firms. Could you assist me in identifying institutional holders that maintain significant positions (pctHeld > 0.05, representing holdings exceeding 5% of outstanding shares) across all four of these prominent companies: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL)? Specifically, I need to compile a comprehensive list of institutional entities ('Holder' field) that satisfy both criteria: (1) appearing in the institutional holdings reports for all four companies, and (2) maintaining the aforementioned 5% threshold in each position. This data will be instrumental for my analysis of cross-portfolio institutional investment strategies in the technology sector.",
