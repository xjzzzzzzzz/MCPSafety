Say I put $60,000 into stocks on March 15, 2024, and I split it evenly between three companies: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), and NVIDIA (NVDA). That means $20,000 goes into each one. Can you calculate what the total value of all my stocks would be worth and how much money I made or lost as a percentage by the time the market closed on March 14, 2025?",
