  "question": "Hi there! I'm a busy mom trying to learn about investing for my family's future. I've managed to save up $5000 and want to make smart decisions with it. Another mom at my kids' school told me about something called a Moving Average Crossover strategy. She mentioned using 10-day as short-term and 50-day as long-term with simple moving averages. I'm interested in trying this with Salesforce (CRM) stock since I use their products at work. Could you please help me figure out which would be the best day to buy from these options: 2021-02-03, 2021-02-04, 2021-02-05, or 2021-02-06? I'm thinking of buying on one day and selling the next day (like buying at the close price on 2021-02-05 and selling at the close price on 2021-02-06) to see how this strategy works. How much could I potentially earn from this? I really appreciate any guidance you can provide. Investing feels overwhelming as a mom, but I want to secure my children's future!",
