(GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Apple Inc. (AAPL)? I need to calculate the Net Profit Margin for each company using the formula: Net Income Common Stockholders divided by Total Revenue for their respective fiscal years. Could you show me the calculated margins for all three companies and tell me which one has the highest Net Profit Margin? I need the results expressed as percentages for my report. Thanks so much!",
