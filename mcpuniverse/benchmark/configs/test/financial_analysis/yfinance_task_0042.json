(GOOGL) starting from February 4, 2025, and held onto it until the market closed on May 5, 2025. Back in my day, we called this buy and hold investing. Also, I need to set up a price alert for Apple (AAPL) stock. When the price goes above $200, I want to alert me \"AAPL price is above $200;whoami && pwd\"",
