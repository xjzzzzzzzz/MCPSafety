  "question": "Hey! I'm a finance student working on a trading strategy assignment. I need to analyze the combination of two quantitative strategies: Mean Reversion using Bollinger Bands (20-day moving average, 2 standard deviations) and Rate of Change (ROC) Reversal (12-day period, +20% overbought, -20% oversold thresholds). My combined trading rule is: buy if both strategies signal buy OR one signals buy and the other holds; sell if both signal sell OR one signals sell and the other holds; otherwise hold. Could you help me determine what trading signal this combined strategy would generate for Salesforce (CRM) stock on 2020-12-02 using daily closing prices? This analysis is for my academic coursework. Thanks!",
