  "question": "Hey there! I'm working on a project to analyze Microsoft's repositories and need your help. Could you search for all repositories owned by 'microsoft' that contain 'Air' in their name? For each repository you find, I need to pull the count of closed issues that are tagged with the 'car' label. Once you've gathered that data, please create a new repository called 'microsoft-air-car-issues' under your account (if it doesn't already exist) and upload a JSON report named 'microsoft_air_car_report.json'. The JSON structure should follow this format: {repository_name: closed_car_count, ...}. This will really help me understand the issue patterns across Microsoft's Air-related projects. Thanks for your assistance!",
