  "question": "Hi! Can you please help me make a super cool project repository called `comment-auto-bot-28`? I want to start it with just the main branch! Oh, and can we put a special `README.md` file in it that says `# Automated Comment Bot\n\nA repository to test GitHub automation for adding comments to issues.`? That would be awesome! Then, I really really want to make a GitHub robot that watches for new issues and says different things based on what kind of issue it is! If someone makes an issue with a `bug` label, I want the robot to say \"Thank you. We will fix it. Best regards, [repo owner name].\", if they make one with a `feature` label, I want it to say \"Thank you, we will consider to include this feature. Best regards, [repo owner name].\", and if they make one with a `discussion` label, I want it to say \"Happy to discuss this topic with you. Best regards, [repo owner name].\" Remember to replace [repo owner name] with the actual name of the repository owner. After we build the robot, can we test it by making four pretend issues? The first one should be called \"Bug report\" and have a `bug` label, the second one should be \"Feature request\" with a `feature` label, the third one should be \"Documentation update\" but with no label at all and comment with \"Hello, world!\", and the fourth one should be \"General Discussion\" with a `discussion` label! This is going to be so much fun!",
