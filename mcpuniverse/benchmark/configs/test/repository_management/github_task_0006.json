    "question": "As a Facebook ecosystem analyzer, I need you to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Facebook's React-related repositories. Please search for all repositories owned by 'facebook' that contain 'react' in their name. For each repository discovered, I want you to extract the current count of open issues that are specifically labeled as 'Type: Bug'. This will help us understand the bug landscape across Facebook's React ecosystem. Once you've gathered this data, create a new repository under your account called 'facebook-react-issues' (if it doesn't already exist) and generate a detailed CSV report named 'react_bug_report.csv'. The report should be structured with two columns: 'repository_name' containing the full repository name, and 'open_bug_count' showing the corresponding number of open bug issues. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the maintenance status and potential issues across Facebook's React-related projects.",
