  "question": "Hey! So I've got these 4 repositories to work with: QwenLM's Qwen2.5-VL, deepseek-ai's DeepSeek-VL2, rhymes-ai's Aria, and Moonshot AI's Kimi-VL. I need to fork whichever one doesn't use MoE (Mixture of Experts) in their models. Just keep the same name as the original repo. Then I gotta add three reference links at the bottom of the README.md file pointing to the other three repos like this: '1. related project [repo name 1](the link of repo 1)', '2. related project [repo name 2](the link of repo 2)', '3. related project [repo name 3](the link of repo 3)'. Pretty straightforward!",
