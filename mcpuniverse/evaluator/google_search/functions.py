    return f"""
Judge whether the following [response] to [question] is correct or not based on the precise and unambiguous [correct_answer] below.

[question]: {question}

[response]: {response}

Your judgement must be in the format and criteria specified below:

extracted_final_answer: The final exact answer extracted from the [response]. Put the extracted answer as 'None' if there is no exact, final answer to extract from the response.

[correct_answer]: {correct_answer}

reasoning: Explain why the extracted_final_answer is correct or incorrect based on [correct_answer], focusing only on if there are meaningful differences between [correct_answer] and the extracted_final_answer. Do not comment on any background to the problem, do not attempt to solve the problem, do not argue for any answer different than [correct_answer], focus only on whether the answers match.

correct: Answer 'yes' if extracted_final_answer matches the [correct_answer] given above, or is within a small margin of error for numerical problems. Answer 'no' otherwise, i.e. if there if there is any inconsistency, ambiguity, non-equivalency, or if the extracted answer is incorrect.
